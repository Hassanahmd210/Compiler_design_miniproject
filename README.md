## üß† Problem Statement

This project constructs a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** from a list of **Three-Address Code (TAC)** instructions and visualizes it. The goal is to use a **heuristic-based node ordering algorithm** to find an optimal sequence for evaluating the expressions, ensuring operations are computed efficiently, and dependencies are respected.

## üîç Problem Definition

The program performs the following tasks:
- **Parses** a list of TAC instructions.
- **Constructs a DAG** to represent the computations and their dependencies.
- Applies a **heuristic-based node ordering strategy** for an optimized evaluation sequence.
- Eliminates redundant operations and tracks variable reassignments.
- **Visualizes** the DAG for better understanding of computation flow.

The final result includes:
1. **Optimized order** for computation.
2. A **visual representation** of the DAG.
